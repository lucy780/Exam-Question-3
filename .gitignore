Q2.
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
STA FIRST
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
STA SECOND 
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
ADD FIRST-add the first value of given mailbox onto the accumulator
ADD SECOND- add the second value of the given mailbox onto the first value on the accumulator
OUT- copy the value from the accumulator to the 'outbox'
HLT- stop executing program 
FIRST DAT- when program compiled convert value into a 3 digit code
SECOND DAT- when program compiled convert value into a 3 digit code

INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
STA FIRST- store first value on accumulator to the mailbox of the given address
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
STA SECOND- store the second value on accumulator to the mailbox of the given address
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
STA THIRD- store the third value on accumulator to the mailbox the givem address
INP- load value of mailbox to accumulator 
ADD FIRST- add the first value of given mailbox onto the accumulator
ADD SECOND- add the second value of the given mailbox onto the first value on the accumulator
ADD THIRD- add the thirs value of the given mailbox onto the first and second values on the accumulator
OUT-copy the value from the accumulator to the 'outbox'
HLT-stop executing program
FIRST DAT- when program compiled convert value into a 3 digit code
SECOND DAT- when program compiled convert value into a 3 digit code
THIRD DAT- when program compiled convert value into a 3 digit code


Q3-
Load-Load the values of the given mailbox onto the accumulator. Note: the contents of the mailbox won't change.
Store- Store the values of the accumulator to the mailbox of the given address. Note: the contents of the accumulator won't change.
Add-Add the values of the given mailbox onto the accumulator. Note: the contents of the mailbox are not changed, and the actions of the accumulator are not defined for add instructions that cause sums larger than 3 digits.
Subtract-Subtract the values of the given mailbox onto the accumulator. Note: the contents of the mailbox won't change, and the actions of the accumulator are not defined for subtract instructions that cause negative results -- however, a negative flag will be set so that BRP can be used properly 
Input-Copy the value from the "in box" onto the accumulator.
Output-Copy the value from the accumulator to the "out box". Note: the contents of the accumulator will not change.
End-Causes the Little Man Computer to stop executing your program.
Branch if zero-If the contents of the accumulator are 000, the PC (program counter) will be set to the given address.  Note: since the program is stored in memory, data and program instructions all have the same address/location format.
Branch if zero or positive-If the contents of the accumulator are 000 or positive (i.e. the negative flag is not set), the PC (program counter) will be set to the given address.  Note: since the program is stored in memory, data and program instructions all have the same address/location format.
Branch always-Set the contents of the accumulator to the given address.  Note: since the program is stored in memory, data and program instructions all have the same address/location format.
Data location-When compiled, a program converts each instruction into a three-digit code.  These codes are placed in sequential mailboxes.  Instead of a program component, this instruction will reserve the next mailbox for data storage.

5.  I am happy with what I was able to do. However, I feel that I need to work more on actually applying the assembly language to the program itself. I found this task very useful as I am now feel that I understand assembly language better.

6. On the LMC there are limited instructions available to use in making a program so it is nearly impossible to create a complex programme such as a word processor using the LMC. Also, there are no easy ways to complete tasks such a multiplication. If there was to be other instructions for all the things needed, it would be a very long programme and very hard to understand.
